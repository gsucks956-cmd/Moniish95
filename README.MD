MoniishOS OS/Or MonolithicOS is a 64-bit monolithic hobby operating system
focused on a fast CLI-first experience.
This is a personal project I'm working on to learn more about operating systems and low-level programming.
This project is not meant to be used as a production operating system, but rather as a learning experience.
The goal of this project is to create a simple, fast, and reliable operating system that can run on modern hardware.
I will listen to feedback and suggestions to improve the project.
Made with C, C++, and Assembly.
